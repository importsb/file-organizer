# file-organizer
A Python based file management tool. It scans a directory, and automatically organizes files into categorized folders. It sorts files by extension into categories such as images, docs, audio, video, etc. I built this to practice working with files and folders, loops, conditionals, and moving files with Python.

## features
- Creates folders automatically if they do not exist
- Renames duplicates so nothing is overwritten
- Sorts by file extensions such as jpeg, docx, mp4, avi
- Moves files into created folders(named after the file extensions)
  
## how to use
1. Enter the folder name when prompted
2. The program will show that folder and what files are inside
3. Files will be moved into new folders based on their extension
4. Repeat with another folder if you want to organize more files

## requirements  
Python 3.x (No third party libraries used)
